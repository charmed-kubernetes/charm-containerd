# Charm for Containerd

This subordinate charm deploys the [Containerd](https://containerd.io/)
engine within a running Juju model. Containerd is an open platform
for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications
in containers.

Containerd focuses on distributing applications as containers that can be quickly
assembled from components that are run the same on different servers without
environmental dependencies. This eliminates the friction between development,
QA, and production environments.

This charm is a component of Charmed Kubernetes. For full information,
please visit the [official Charmed Kubernetes docs](https://www.ubuntu.com/kubernetes/docs/charm-containerd).
